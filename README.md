## About Me

I'm an economist passionate about extracting actionable insights from complex datasets. I have a keen interest in leveraging technology, automation, machine learning, predictive analysis, and Big Data to optimize processes and fuel innovation. With experience at top consulting firms (Ernst & Young), major banks (BBVA), and software development companies (Playtomic), I've enhanced my analytical and problem-solving skills. I'm committed to continuous learning and professional development, open to new challenges.

## Projects

### [Income Generating Customer Classification Model](https://github.com/AndresDosReis/Income-Generating-Customer-Classification)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white)
![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-scikit--learn-F7931E?logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)

Developed 3 predictive models (Neural Networks, Random Forests, and Logistic Regression Model) to accurately forecast customers that generate revenue for a retail company's online platform. Concluded that Neural Networks is the most accurate for predicting revenue streams, offering actionable insights to optimize marketing strategies and enhance revenue generation.

### [Client Clustering with K-means](https://github.com/AndresDosReis/Client-Clustering-Kmeans)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white)
![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-scikit--learn-F7931E?logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)

Implemented a clustering solution using the KMeans algorithm to segment wholesale customers. Determined the optimal number of clusters using the elbow method and visualized cluster distributions to interpret cluster behavior effectively.

### [Credit Risk Prediction ML](https://github.com/AndresDosReis/Credit-Risk-Prediction)
![Python](https://img.shields.io/badge/-Python-3776AB?logo=python&logoColor=white)
![scikit-learn](https://img.shields.io/badge/-scikit--learn-F7931E?logo=scikit-learn&logoColor=white)

Built a predictive model using MLPClassifier (neural network) to forecast the probability of default. Conducted in-depth analysis of credit risk data using Python, and generated informative visualizations to unveil key insights, evaluating model performance with accuracy, sensitivity, and precision metrics.

### [Salaries Predictor ML](https://github.com/AndresDosReis/Salaries-Predictor)
